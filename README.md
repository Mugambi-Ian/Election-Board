# Election Board
This app serves as a terminal to control the date, time, length and participation of an election. I would like to note that this version was specifically built for my school.

## Getting Started
This project only contains information related to the election board terminal. To access information on the Voters terminal click [here](https://github.com/nenecorporates/Vote).

1.On opening the app, it checks for ongoing elections. If there exists none the user will be presented with a screen to begin preparation.

2. The user will then be required to set the election date, time and the duration of the elections in hours.
